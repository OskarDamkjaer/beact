## understanding fiber

### https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html

The objects we are creating from jsx are the output of the function inputs (props). ReactDom will later do the actual rendering.
An element is a plain object describing what you would like to see in terms of dom nodes / components.

a component creates elements from props.

### https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html

the algorithm for reconsil uses the following heuristics:

1.  Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
2.  The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.

knowing what to rerender and component instances (this/state) is reused in lists based on the item keys.

"That's the purpose of React Fiber. Fiber is reimplementation of the stack, specialized for React components. You can think of a single fiber as a virtual stack frame.""

## react as a UI-runtime och mer frÃ¥n overreacted

## difference to svelte

react approach -> rerender whole app in vdom, use alogrithm to see what changed, change only those things in real dom. Heuristics and so on make each step more efficient by skipping work.

svelte -> in compilestep figure out templates dependance on data, then rerender templates that have a dependance on data changed, this way you know what has changed without simulating the change and diffing.
